Engineering Managers spend their days juggling between Jira for delivery, GitHub for technical work, and scattered notes for the human side. 
**EM Kit** is the first 'Local-First' command center that finally brings these worlds together to transform team management into an exact science, without ever compromising privacy.

Being an EM means trying to remember what a developer did 3 months ago during their performance review, while preparing this afternoon's 1:1 and summarising this morning's Daily. Current tools are either too generic (Notion) or too ticket-focused (Jira), and often pose HR data security issues.

**EM Kit** is a lightweight, ultra-fast desktop application that connects to your dev tools but keeps your reflections where they belong: **on your machine.**

- **1-on-1s with Context:** No more preparing your points in a vacuum. Visualize your team member's PRs and tickets directly in your note-taking interface.
- **Intelligent Daily Sync:** EM Kit scans GitHub for you and generates a summary of recent changes. You no longer ask "What's new?", you discuss blockers.
- **Painless Performance Reviews:** No more digging through Jira at the end of the semester. Mark "evidences" (a brilliant PR, a complex ticket resolved) throughout the year and generate your reviews with one click.
- **Privacy by Design:** No account, no cloud, no data leaks. Your feedback and strategic notes are encrypted locally.

Give managers quality time back for what truly matters: coaching and growing their engineers, not filling out dashboards.
