## Open a member review

You can open a member review from:

- **Performance -> Team Summary**
- **My Team -> Member -> Performance Reviews**

## Header controls

At the top of the review page, you can set:

- **Status**
- **Rating**

## Review tabs

### Overview

Write review notes and maintain highlights for impact and improvement.

### Initiatives

Create initiatives, add Jira keys, and link evidences.

### Evidences

Fetch evidence (currently GitHub), filter by source, and clear stale items.

### Timeline

Browse activities over time for the review period.

### Objectives Checkin

Review objectives that overlap the review dates.

### Peer Feedbacks

## Recommended flow

1. Set status and rating only after evidence is complete.
2. Group work into initiatives first.
3. Add peer feedback before final synthesis in Overview notes.
