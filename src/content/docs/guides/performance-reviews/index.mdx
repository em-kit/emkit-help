import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

EM Kit supports both team-level review planning and member-level review execution.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Review Periods" href="review-periods" />
  <LinkCard title="Member Review" href="member-review" />
</CardGrid>

## Main entry points

- **Performance** (left sidebar): create and manage review periods, then track team summary.
- **My Team -> Member -> Performance Reviews**: open a member's reviews directly.

> Screenshot placeholder: add the Performance overview page here.
