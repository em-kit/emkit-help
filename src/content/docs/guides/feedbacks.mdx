## Where to find it

- Global view: open **Feedback** from the left sidebar.
- Member view: open **My Team -> Member -> Feedbacks**.

## Add feedback

Each feedback entry includes:

- Team member target
- Author name
- Type (`Recognition` or `Improvement`)
- Content
- Status (`To Share` or `Shared`)

## Manage feedback lifecycle

- Filter by status
- Edit or delete existing feedback
- Mark feedback as shared after discussing it
- Move shared feedback back to to-share when needed

## Tip

Use feedback entries during one-on-ones to keep delivery consistent and well documented.
