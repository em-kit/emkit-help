description: Privacy policy for EM Kit
---

**Last Updated:** 12th February 2026  
**Product:** EM Kit ("the Application")

At EM Kit, we believe that your management notes and team insights are yours alone. Our privacy philosophy is simple: **What happens on your machine, stays on your machine.**

---

## 1. No Data Collection
EM Kit does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data, meeting notes, feedback, or any other content you create within the application to our servers. We do not have user accounts, and we do not have access to your database.

## 2. Local-First Storage
* **Data Residency:** All application data, including your notes and "evidence" logs, is stored locally on your device in standard formats (SQLite database and Markdown files).
* **No Cloud Sync:** By default, EM Kit does not sync your data to any cloud service. If you choose to back up your data using third-party tools (like Dropbox, iCloud, or Git), that data is subject to the privacy policy of those respective providers.

## 3. Third-Party Integrations (GitHub & Jira)
EM Kit allows you to integrate with GitHub and Jira to pull contextual information.
* **Direct Connection:** The Application communicates directly from your device to the GitHub and Jira APIs. Your data does not pass through any intermediary servers owned by EM Kit.
* **Token Security:** Your API tokens and OAuth credentials are stored locally and encrypted using your operating system's secure storage (where available).

## 4. Telemetry and Analytics (Optional)
*To help us improve EM Kit, we may collect anonymous usage data (e.g., "was the 1-on-1 feature opened?") and crash reports.*
* **Anonymity:** This data is strictly technical and does not include any of your notes, names, or sensitive content.
* **Opt-out:** You can disable telemetry at any time in the Application settings. [Optional: "We currently do not use any telemetry."]

## 5. Local AI Processing
If you use AI features (such as Daily summaries or evidence categorization), the processing is handled as follows:
* **Option A (Local AI):** If using a local model, no data leaves your machine.
* **Option B (API-based):** If you connect your own OpenAI/Anthropic API key, your data is sent directly to those providers for processing. Please refer to their respective privacy policies.

## 6. Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA)
Because we do not collect or store your data, we do not "process" your personal information in the traditional sense. You have full control over your data: you can view, export, or delete your SQLite and Markdown files at any time without our permission or assistance.

## 7. Security
Since your data is stored locally, its security depends on the security of your device. We recommend using full-disk encryption (like FileVault or BitLocker) and following standard security practices for your hardware.
