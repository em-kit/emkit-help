## 1. Description of Service
EM Kit is a local-first desktop application designed for Engineering Managers. It provides tools for 1-on-1 management, performance reviews, and task tracking by integrating with third-party services like GitHub and Jira.

## 2. Data Ownership & Privacy (Local-First)
Your privacy is a core feature of EM Kit.
* **No Central Servers:** EM Kit does not require a user account. We do not host, store, or have access to your notes, feedback, or any data generated within the app.
* **Local Storage:** All data is stored locally on your device in SQLite and Markdown formats. 
* **Data Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for the backup, security, and encryption of your local data files. EM Kit is not responsible for any data loss resulting from hardware failure, accidental deletion, or unauthorized access to your device.

## 3. Third-Party Integrations
EM Kit allows you to connect to third-party services (e.g., GitHub, Jira). 
* **API Tokens:** Any API tokens or OAuth credentials provided by you are stored locally on your machine.
* **Third-Party Terms:** By using these integrations, you agree to comply with the respective Terms of Service of those providers. We are not responsible for changes, downtime, or data issues caused by these third-party APIs.

## 4. Intellectual Property
* **The Software:** The Application (code, design, logo, and assets) is the intellectual property of the EM Kit creator(s). You are granted a limited, non-transferable license to use the software.
* **User Content:** You retain 100% ownership of the content you create (notes, summaries, evidence logs). We claim no rights over your data.

## 5. Prohibited Use
You agree not to:
* Attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or extract the source code of the Application (unless permitted by an open-source license, if applicable).
* Use the application for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
* Use the application to store data that violates privacy laws or company policies you are bound by.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE CREATORS OF EM KIT DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE APPLICATION WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT ACCESS TO IT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. USE THE APPLICATION AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CREATORS OF EM KIT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SERVICE.

## 8. Changes to These Terms
We may update our Terms of Service from time to time. As there is no account system, we will notify users of changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document and through in-app release notes.
