title: EM Kit CLI
description: Install and use the EM Kit Command Line Tool for local-first workflows.
---

The **EM Kit CLI** lets you query and update EM Kit data from your terminal.

- Works with the EM Kit desktop app runtime.
- If EM Kit is not running, the first CLI command launches it automatically.
- Supports both one-shot commands and an interactive TUI.
- Focuses on EM Kit local data (no GitHub CLI replacement).

## Install from EM Kit desktop

1. Open **Settings -> Command Line Tool**.
2. Click **Install Command Line Tool**.
3. Confirm the install location.

On macOS, the default install directory is:

```bash
~/.emkit
```

The executable path is typically:

```bash
~/.emkit/emkit
```

## Add to PATH

If you see `CLI install directory is not in PATH`, add the install directory to your shell PATH.

### zsh (default on macOS)

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.emkit:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### bash

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.emkit:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### fish

```fish
fish_add_path $HOME/.emkit
```

Verify:

```bash
which emkit
emkit help
```

## Usage modes

### One-shot commands

```bash
emkit doctor
emkit workspace list
emkit member list --workspace-id 1
```

### Interactive TUI

```bash
emkit
# or
emkit tui
```

TUI supports:

- Tab autocomplete
- Up/down history
- `help` and `quit`

## Common commands

```bash
emkit doctor
emkit workspace list
emkit workspace get --id 1
emkit workspace create --name "Platform"
emkit workspace update --id 1 --name "Platform Team"
emkit workspace delete --id 1

emkit member list --workspace-id 1
emkit member get --id 2
emkit member create --input '{"workspace_id":1,"name":"Jane Doe"}'
emkit member update --id 2 --input '{"name":"Jane D."}'
emkit member delete --id 2

emkit evidence list --member-id 2
emkit evidence get --id 10
emkit evidence create --member-id 2 --input '{"title":"Incident leadership","description":"Led production recovery"}'
emkit evidence delete --id 10
emkit evidence clear --member-id 2 --source github

emkit report history --workspace-id 1
emkit report get --report-id 12
emkit report delete --report-id 12

emkit db query --sql 'SELECT id, name FROM workspaces LIMIT 10'
emkit db exec --sql 'UPDATE workspaces SET name = ? WHERE id = ?' --params '["Platform",1]'
```

## JSON output

CLI responses are JSON, which makes it easy to consume from scripts and AI agents.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "workspace list",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      { "id": 1, "name": "Platform" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Use compact output when needed:

```bash
emkit workspace list --compact
```

## Troubleshooting

### CLI install directory is still reported as not in PATH

1. Make sure your shell config contains `$HOME/.emkit` (or your selected install directory).
2. Open a **new terminal window** (or `source` your shell config).
3. Check current PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

4. Re-run **Refresh** in EM Kit Settings -> Command Line Tool.

### Install directory is not writable

Create the directory and set ownership:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.emkit
chown -R "$USER" ~/.emkit
```

Then install again from EM Kit Settings.

### Development mode behavior

If EM Kit is running via `npm run dev:electron`, the installed dev launcher can target your dev app runtime. Keep the dev app running while testing terminal commands.
